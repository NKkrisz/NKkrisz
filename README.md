## Some Things I Like To Say / Live By:
- *Trying to teach things to other people can help show your own weaknesses which you can later improve upon.*
- *There is still time left (say this when you clearly don't have any time left).*
- *It's useful to know that you don't know everything.*
- *Good headphones stay good.*
- *Have you tried restarting it?*
- *Try making things simple!*
